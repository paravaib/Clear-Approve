    <p>Clear Approve operates entirely within your Google Workspace environment. We minimize data access to ensure your business remains secure.</p>

    <h2>Data Access & Usage</h2>
    <p>Clear Approve accesses only the active Google Sheet where it is explicitly enabled. The add-on reads row data to generate approval emails and writes status metadata back to your sheet.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All approval data and audit logs are stored <b>only</b> within your Google Spreadsheet. We do not store your spreadsheet content on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Google User Data Policy</h2>
    <p>Clear Approve's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
