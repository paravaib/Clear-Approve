# How to Share Part of a Google Sheet Without Giving Access

You need to send a few rows or a section of your spreadsheet to someone—a client, a stakeholder, a vendor—but you don’t want to give them access to the whole sheet. Maybe it has other data, formulas, or notes they shouldn’t see. Or you just want to send a snapshot of the current numbers without inviting them into the file.

**The problem:** Google Sheets is built around sharing the whole file. You can share “view only” or “comment only,” but that still means they see everything in that sheet (and possibly other sheets in the same file). There’s no built-in way to share “just these 12 rows” or “just this table” and nothing else.

## Why the usual workarounds don’t work well

**Sharing the sheet with “view only”**  
They see the entire spreadsheet. If you have multiple tabs or sensitive columns, you either have to hide things (easy to forget, easy to unhide) or accept that they see more than you intended.

**Screenshots**  
They’re static, hard to read if the selection is large, and look unprofessional. Recipients can’t copy numbers or search the content. One layout change and your screenshot is wrong.

**Copy-pasting into email or a doc**  
Formatting breaks. Tables turn into a mess. You spend time fixing alignment and borders. It doesn’t scale if you do this often.

**Downloading as PDF and attaching**  
If you print the whole sheet, they get everything. If you try to print “only this range,” you’re constantly adjusting print areas and page breaks. It’s manual and brittle.

What you actually need is: **select the rows (or range) you want, send that—and only that—as a clean, read-only snapshot. No access to the rest of the sheet.**

## A simple way: send only what you select

Clear Approve is a Google Sheets add-on that does exactly that. You select the rows (or range) you want to share. The add-on turns that selection into a clean, read-only snapshot and sends it by email. Recipients get the data you chose—nothing else. They don’t need access to the spreadsheet, and they never see the rest of your sheet.

- **Small selections** are sent as a tidy HTML table in the email body.  
- **Larger selections** are sent as a PDF attachment so the email stays readable.  
- You don’t take screenshots, mess with sharing settings, or export the whole sheet.

## How it works

1. **Install Clear Approve** from the Google Workspace Marketplace and open your Google Sheet.
2. **Select the rows or range** you want to share (e.g. a project status table, a few columns, a report block).
3. **Run the add-on** and choose “Send snapshot” (or the equivalent action).
4. **Enter the recipient’s email** and add an optional message.
5. **Send.** They receive a read-only snapshot of only what you selected. No link to the sheet, no access to the file.

You stay in control: only the current sheet is used, and only the data you select is sent.

## Who this is for

- People who need to send **specific sections** of a sheet (e.g. one project, one region, one month) without sharing the whole file.  
- Teams that use one master sheet but report to different clients or stakeholders who shouldn’t see each other’s data.  
- Anyone who’s tired of “view only” sharing, screenshots, or manual PDF exports when they only want to share part of a Google Sheet.
