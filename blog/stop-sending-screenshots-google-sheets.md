# Stop Sending Screenshots from Google Sheets (Do This Instead)

You need to get a slice of your Google Sheet to someone quickly—a status table, a few rows of data, a summary. So you take a screenshot and paste it into email or Slack. It’s fast, but the result is hard to read, not searchable, and looks informal. When the data changes, you have to screenshot again. You’ve probably wondered if there’s a better way.

**The problem:** Screenshots are a workaround, not a solution. They lock your data into an image. Recipients can’t copy numbers, search, or resize text. Long tables become tiny or split across multiple images. And every update means a new screenshot and a new message.

## Why screenshots are a bad fit for spreadsheet data

**They don’t scale**  
A few rows might be okay. A wide table or many rows becomes unreadable or requires several screenshots. Scrolling through multiple images is worse than getting a single, clean table or PDF.

**They’re not professional**  
Screenshots signal “quick and temporary.” For client updates, stakeholder reports, or anything you send regularly, a clean table or PDF looks more intentional and trustworthy.

**They’re static and high-maintenance**  
Data changes; screenshots don’t. You have to remember to re-screenshot and re-send. There’s no “same selection, updated data” without manual work.

**Recipients can’t use the data**  
They can’t copy a value, search for a name, or paste into their own sheet. The content is trapped in an image.

What you want is the same ease—“grab this part and send it”—but as **real content**: readable, professional, and easy to update. That means sending the selected rows as a clean email or PDF, not as a screenshot.

## Do this instead: send a read-only snapshot of your selection

Clear Approve is a Google Sheets add-on that turns your selection into a read-only snapshot and sends it by email. You select the rows (or range) you want, run the add-on, and add the recipient. They get an email with that data as a formatted table (for smaller selections) or as a PDF (for larger ones). No screenshot, no link to the sheet, no need for them to have access.

- You still “grab this part and send it”—but the result is clean text/PDF, not an image.  
- Small selections = tidy HTML table in the email. Large selections = PDF attachment.  
- Only the current sheet is used; only what you select is sent.

## How it works

1. **Install Clear Approve** from the Google Workspace Marketplace and open your Google Sheet.
2. **Select the rows or range** you’d normally screenshot (e.g. a status table, a block of data).
3. **Run the add-on** and choose to send a snapshot.
4. **Enter the recipient’s email** and an optional message.
5. **Send.** They receive a clean, read-only snapshot of that selection—no screenshot, no spreadsheet access.

Next time the data changes, you select the same (or updated) range and send again. No re-screenshotting.

## Who this is for

- People who **currently screenshot** Google Sheets to send updates, reports, or data slices and want a cleaner, repeatable approach.  
- Anyone who wants recipients to **read and use** the data (copy, search) instead of viewing an image.  
- Teams that send **regular updates** from a sheet and are tired of maintaining multiple screenshots.
