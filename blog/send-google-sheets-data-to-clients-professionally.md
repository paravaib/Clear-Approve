# How to Send Google Sheets Data to Clients Professionally

You use Google Sheets to track projects, deliverables, or metrics. Your clients need to see updates—status, numbers, lists—but you don’t want to give them access to the live sheet. You want to send them exactly what they need, in a format that looks deliberate and easy to read, without “view only” links, screenshots, or messy copy-paste.

**The problem:** Sharing the sheet means they see the whole file (and possibly other tabs). Screenshots look ad hoc. Pasting tables into email often breaks formatting. Downloading and attaching PDFs means fiddling with print ranges every time. There’s no straightforward way to “send this client just this slice of the sheet, clean and professional.”

## Why common approaches don’t work well for client communication

**Sharing the sheet with “view only”**  
They see everything: other clients’ rows, internal notes, future plans. You’d have to duplicate sheets or hide rows, which is error-prone and hard to maintain.

**Screenshots**  
Fine for one-off Slack messages; weak for client-facing updates. They’re not searchable, they don’t scale to large tables, and they signal “quick and informal” rather than “prepared and professional.”

**Copy-paste into email**  
Tables lose alignment and structure. Clients get a wall of text or a broken layout. It doesn’t reflect well when you’re trying to look polished.

**Manual PDF export**  
You set a print area, export, attach. It works once, but when you have multiple clients or frequent updates, the manual steps add up. One mistake in the range and you’ve sent the wrong slice.

What you need is: **choose the rows (or range) for that client → send them as a clean, read-only snapshot.** Professional, repeatable, and under your control.

## A professional approach: client-specific snapshots

Clear Approve is a Google Sheets add-on that lets you select the rows you want to send, then sends them as a read-only snapshot by email. Recipients get a clear table (for smaller selections) or a PDF (for larger ones). They don’t get a link to the sheet or access to the file—just the data you chose, in their inbox.

- **One sheet, many clients:** Select different ranges for different clients and send each their own snapshot.  
- **Consistent format:** No screenshots or broken pastes—just clean HTML or PDF.  
- **No access management:** You’re not sharing the sheet; you’re sending a snapshot of a selection.

## How it works

1. **Install Clear Approve** from the Google Workspace Marketplace and open your Google Sheet.
2. **Select the rows** that belong to this client (e.g. their project rows, their metrics, their deliverable list).
3. **Run the add-on** and choose to send a snapshot.
4. **Enter the client’s email** and an optional message (e.g. “Here’s your weekly status”).
5. **Send.** The client receives a professional, read-only snapshot of only that selection—no sheet link, no access.

For the next client, select their rows and repeat. Same workflow, different selection.

## Who this is for

- **Agencies and consultants** who track work in one sheet but report to multiple clients and don’t want to share the full file.  
- **Account and project managers** who send regular status or data updates and want them to look clean and intentional.  
- Anyone who wants to **send Google Sheets data to clients professionally** without giving spreadsheet access or relying on screenshots and manual PDFs.
