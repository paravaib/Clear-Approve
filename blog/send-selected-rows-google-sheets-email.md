# How to Send Selected Rows from Google Sheets by Email

You have a Google Sheet with dozens or hundreds of rows, but you only need to send a subset—a status update for one project, a list of tasks for one person, or a data slice for a report. You want those rows in the recipient’s inbox, readable and self-contained, without giving them access to the spreadsheet or pasting ugly tables into email.

**The problem:** Google Sheets doesn’t have a “send these rows by email” feature. You’re left choosing between sharing the whole file, copying into email (and losing formatting), or taking screenshots. None of these gives you “just these rows, clean, by email.”

## Why the default options fall short

**Sharing the sheet**  
The recipient sees the entire sheet (and possibly other tabs). They can scroll, see formulas, see data you didn’t mean to share. You don’t get “only these rows.”

**Copy and paste into email**  
Tables often break. Alignment and borders are lost. Large pastes make the email hard to read. It’s fine once or twice; it doesn’t scale.

**Screenshots**  
They’re images. Text isn’t selectable or searchable. Long tables become multiple images or tiny text. It looks informal and is hard to maintain.

**Print range to PDF**  
You can set a print area and save as PDF, then attach. But you’re manually adjusting ranges and print settings every time. No automation, no “select rows → send.”

What’s missing is a direct path: **select the rows → send them by email as a clean, read-only snapshot.** No link to the sheet, no access, no manual export.

## Sending selected rows with Clear Approve

Clear Approve is a Google Sheets add-on that sends only the rows (or range) you select. You highlight the rows you want, run the add-on, add the recipient and an optional message, and send. They get an email with exactly that data—either as a formatted HTML table in the body (for smaller selections) or as a PDF attachment (for larger ones). They don’t need to open the spreadsheet or have any access to it.

- Select any rows (and columns) in your sheet.  
- One action sends them as a read-only snapshot.  
- No screenshots, no full-sheet sharing, no manual PDF export.

## How it works

1. **Install Clear Approve** from the Google Workspace Marketplace and open your Google Sheet.
2. **Select the rows** you want to send (drag to select, or select a range). You can include headers and as many rows as you need.
3. **Open the add-on** from the Extensions menu and choose to send a snapshot.
4. **Enter the recipient’s email** and, if you like, a short message.
5. **Send.** The recipient gets an email containing only the selected rows—as clean HTML in the body or as a PDF attachment, depending on size.

You don’t configure sharing, print areas, or copy-paste. You select and send.

## Who this is for

- Anyone who regularly emails **subsets** of a Google Sheet (e.g. “this week’s tasks,” “this client’s line items,” “this region’s metrics”).  
- People who want recipients to get **only the rows they care about**, without opening the sheet.  
- Teams that need a repeatable way to **send selected rows by email** without sharing the whole file or fiddling with exports.
