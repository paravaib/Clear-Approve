# Email vs PDF: The Best Way to Share Google Sheets Data

You’re about to send someone a chunk of your Google Sheet. Should you put the data in the email body or attach a PDF? Inline tables are quick to read but can get messy when there’s a lot of data. PDFs look clean and printable but add a step for the recipient. You want a simple rule that works for both small updates and big tables.

**The problem:** There’s no single “right” format for every case. A 5-row status update belongs in the email. A 50-row report is better as a PDF. Manually deciding each time—and then building the email or exporting the PDF—is extra work. You want the right format to happen automatically based on how much you’re sending.

## Why picking one format for everything fails

**Always inline (paste or HTML table)**  
Small tables are fine. Large ones make the email long, slow to load, and hard to scan. Some clients prefer a single attachment they can save or print.

**Always PDF**  
Good for reports; overkill for “here are three numbers.” Recipients have to open an attachment for every tiny update. It feels heavy for quick check-ins.

**Manual choice every time**  
You could decide case by case and then create the email or export the PDF yourself. That’s repetitive and easy to get wrong (wrong range, wrong sheet, broken formatting).

The practical approach is: **small selections → readable in the email; large selections → PDF attachment.** So the recipient gets the best experience without you having to think about it each time.

## Let the size of the selection decide

Clear Approve is a Google Sheets add-on that sends your selection as a read-only snapshot by email. It doesn’t force one format. For **smaller selections**, it puts a clean HTML table in the email body—open the email and the data is right there. For **larger selections**, it sends a PDF attachment so the email stays light and the data is easy to save or print. You select the rows, add the recipient, and send; the add-on chooses email vs PDF based on what you selected.

- You don’t choose “email or PDF” every time.  
- Recipients get inline data when it’s short and a PDF when it’s long.  
- No manual export, no copy-paste, no sharing the sheet.

## How it works

1. **Install Clear Approve** from the Google Workspace Marketplace and open your Google Sheet.
2. **Select the rows or range** you want to share (a few rows for a quick update, or a big block for a report).
3. **Run the add-on** and choose to send a snapshot.
4. **Enter the recipient’s email** and an optional message.
5. **Send.** The add-on sends a clean HTML table in the body for small selections, or a PDF attachment for larger ones. Recipients get the data without opening the spreadsheet.

One workflow; the format follows the size of what you’re sending.

## Who this is for

- People who send **both** short updates and longer reports from Google Sheets and want the right format without deciding each time.  
- Anyone who’s unsure whether to **put data in the email or attach a PDF** and wants a single tool that handles both.  
- Teams that want **consistent, read-only snapshots** of sheet data—inline when it’s small, PDF when it’s large—without manual exports or sharing the sheet.
